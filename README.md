# Wireless-Voulume-Control
The Wireless Sound Control project is a Python-based implementation of various Digital Audio Effects (DAFX). The project focuses on manipulating audio signals to create unique listening experiences by applying effects such as delay-based effects, spatial effects, time-varying filters, modulators, and karaoke effects. The project also includes features like 3D spatialization, simulated surround sound, dialogue normalization, and dynamic range control.

The project is implemented using Python due to its extensive libraries and tools for audio signal processing. The code provided in the document demonstrates a wireless volume control system using hand gestures, which is achieved through the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing. The volume is controlled based on the distance between two fingers (thumb and index finger) detected by the camera.

Key Features:
Digital Audio Effects (DAFX):

Delay-based effects (e.g., chorus, flanger, vibrato).

Spatial effects (e.g., reverberation, panning, 3D effects using HRTF).

Time-varying filters (e.g., wah-wah).

Modulators (e.g., tremolo).

Karaoke effect using audio downmixing.

Dialogue Normalization and Dynamic Range Control:

Ensures consistent audio levels across different portions of the audio signal.

Wireless Volume Control:

Uses hand gestures to control the system volume.

Implemented using MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing.

Audio Transcoding and Compression:

Supports .wav files and provides transcoding and compression options.
